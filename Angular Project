#sellerSignUp: This is the template reference variable. It acts as a handle that you can use to reference the form in your component's code.
ngForm: This is the directive that represents an Angular form. The ngForm directive is used to create a form element and manage form controls 
(like input fields, checkboxes, etc.) within the form.You're effectively associating the reference variable sellerSignUp with the form 
created by the ngForm directive. This allows you to access various properties and methods of the form in your component's TypeScript code.

FormsModule: the FormsModule is a built-in module provided by the Angular framework. It's used to handle forms and form controls within 
your application. When you import the FormsModule into your Angular module, you enable various form-related features and directives that 
make it easier to work with forms and manage user input.

ngModel: the ngModel directive is a powerful feature that facilitates two-way data binding for form controls. It's used to bind the value of 
an input, select, or textarea element to a property of a component class. This allows changes made by the user in the view (template) to 
automatically update the component's property, and changes to the component's property to automatically update the view.

subscribe:- the subscribe method is used to initiate an asynchronous operation and listen for the results or events that the operation 
produces. It's commonly used when working with Observables, which are a core part of Angular's reactive programming paradigm.
The subscribe method takes up to three arguments:
  The first argument is a function to handle the emitted values (on next).
  The second argument is a function to handle errors (on error).
  The third argument is a function to handle the completion of the Observable (on complete).
The subscribe method is crucial when working with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, as it allows you to respond 
to the results or events produced by those operations. Keep in mind that when you use subscribe, it's important to also handle 
unsubscription to prevent memory leaks. Angular's async pipe is an alternative way to manage subscriptions in your templates and 
automatically handle unsubscription for you.
